# Memory Card Game

A fun and interactive memory card matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript featuring Ben 10 themed cards in a 4x4 grid layout.

## Why I Built This

This was my **first JavaScript game project** designed to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation. I wanted to create an engaging memory game that would help me understand how to build interactive web applications from scratch.

## Original Objective

- Create a classic concentration/memory matching game
- Implement card flipping animations and matching logic
- Add timer and move counter for game tracking
- Design responsive layout with smooth user interactions
- Learn JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

### JavaScript Fundamentals
- **DOM manipulation** for dynamic content updates
- **Event listeners** for click interactions and game controls
- **Timers and intervals** for game timer functionality
- **Array methods** for card shuffling and matching logic

### CSS & Animations
- **3D transforms** for card flip animations
- **Flexbox layout** for responsive grid design
- **CSS transitions** for smooth visual effects
- **Responsive design** principles for different screen sizes

### Game Development Concepts
- **State management** for tracking game progress
- **Game loop logic** for turn-based interactions
- **Win conditions** and game completion detection
- **User experience design** for intuitive gameplay

## Features

- 16 cards arranged in 4x4 grid with 8 matching pairs
- Smooth card flip animations with 3D transform effects
- Timer tracking elapsed time in MM:SS format
- Move counter to track player efficiency
- Pause/Resume functionality for game control
- Reset button to start fresh games
- Ben 10 themed character images

## Game Mechanics

**Card Layout:** 8 pairs distributed across 16 positions
- Ben 10 & Heat Blast & Big Chill & Alien X
- Omnitrix & Doggy & Four Arms & Electro

**Win Condition:** Match all 8 pairs to complete the game
**Scoring:** Based on moves taken and time elapsed

## Setup & Usage

```bash
# No installation required - just open in browser
open index.html

# Or serve locally
python -m http.server 8000
```

**File Structure:**
- `index.html` - Main game interface
- `style.css` - Styling and animations  
- `script.js` - Game logic and interactions
- `media/` - Card images (9 total: 8 characters + back design)

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

**This is a learning project** with some constraints:
- Fixed 4x4 grid size only
- No difficulty level options
- No sound effects or background music
- No high score persistence or leaderboards
- Basic mobile responsiveness (desktop optimized)

## Future Updates

This project will be enhanced as I learn more advanced web development:
- Multiple difficulty levels (3x4, 5x6, 6x8 grids)
- Sound effects and background music integration
- Local storage for high scores and statistics
- Multiple card themes and character sets
- Improved mobile touch optimization
- Multiplayer functionality

## Current Status

This represents my foundational knowledge of JavaScript game development. It demonstrates core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS animations, and will be updated in future as my skills advance.
